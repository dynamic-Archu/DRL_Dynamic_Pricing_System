DYNAMIC PRICING SYSTEM FOR RETAIL STORES USING DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

1. ABSTRACT


This project presents the development of a Dynamic Pricing System for Retail Stores using Deep 
Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, especially in 
a dynamic market like India, maintaining profitability while staying competitive is a challenge. 
Traditional pricing models, which rely on static or periodic price adjustments, fail to account for 
real-time fluctuations in demand, inventory levels, seasonal variations, and competitor actions. 
This project addresses these limitations by implementing a dynamic pricing system that can 
autonomously adjust product prices based on market conditions.
The primary objective of the system is to maximize revenue and profit by setting optimal prices 
for products in a simulated retail environment. The system evaluates various factors, including 
demand-supply dynamics, competitor pricing, and seasonal trends, to make informed pricing 
decisions. By utilizing DRL, the system continuously learns from interactions with the 
environment and adapts its pricing strategy over time to respond to changes effectively.
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for sequential decisionmaking, where the agent learns to take actions (adjusting prices) by maximizing cumulative 
rewards. In this project, Deep Q-Learning (DQN), an RL algorithm, is employed to train the agent 
to find the most effective pricing strategies. The results demonstrate that the DRL-based system 
achieves better revenue optimization and competitiveness compared to traditional pricing 
approaches. This project showcases the potential of AI-powered pricing systems to revolutionize 
the retail sector by offering real-time adaptability and profitability
